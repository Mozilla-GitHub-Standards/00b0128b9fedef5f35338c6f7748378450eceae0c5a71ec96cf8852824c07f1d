# Co-designing learning pathways for web literacy with the Mozilla community

This whitepaper, a follow-up to [Why Mozilla cares about Web Literacy](http://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-whitepaper), explores and explains learning pathways - with a focus on the Mozilla community. Writing is happening in a [Google Doc](http://goo.gl/yB5FFB) but will be transferred here for publication via GitHub Pages.

Please check out the [Issues](https://github.com/mozilla/learning-pathways-whitepaper/issues) section for details on how development of this whitepaper will take place.
